/**
 * Holder of an item being worked on.
 * <p>
 *     Applicable items are objects whose interfaces cannot be expanded,
 *     and which it may not be sound to wrap into a new, separate interface.
 *     To add functions to this type of item, it can be hold and hence wrapped and operated upon
 *     until it is released and to be used as-is.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The idea to this was triggered by the wish to add rate-limitation to the newer SLF4J fluent API,
 *     where the item in question is {@link org.slf4j.spi.LoggingEventBuilder}.
 *     This ends up in wrapping a fluent API into another fluent API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Note that this is set up for the Self-Referential Generics pattern.
 *     This is intended to have separate sub-interfaces, possibly with a sub-interface to bind the
 *     self-referential generic followed by actual implementations.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <A> Type of self object.
 *            This is the key to apply the Self-Referential Generics pattern.
 * @param <I> Type of item hold.
