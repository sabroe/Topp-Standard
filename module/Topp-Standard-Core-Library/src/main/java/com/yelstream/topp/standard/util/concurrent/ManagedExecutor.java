/**
 * An executor with a managed lifecycle.
 * <p>
 *     This addresses various scenarios where an executor might need to be closed or retained based on specific requirements.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         From Java SE 19, {@link ExecutorService} implements {@link AutoCloseable},
 *         while {@link Executor} remains a basic interface without a close capability.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         There are cases where an executor needs to be disposed, and cases where it must be retained.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Some applications, such as reactive programming with {@link CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(Supplier, Executor)},
 *         might require an {@link Executor} but benefit from an {@link ExecutorService} lifecycle management.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *     The executor's lifecycle is managed externally while ensuring consistent closure internally.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Although Java SE 19 extended {@link ExecutorService} to be {@link AutoCloseable},
 *     managing a plain {@link Executor} without close functionality remains challenging.
 * </p>
