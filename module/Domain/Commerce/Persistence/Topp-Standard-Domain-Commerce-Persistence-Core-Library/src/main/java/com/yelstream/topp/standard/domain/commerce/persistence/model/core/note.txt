Why this set supports both worlds well

B2C flow (simple & fast)
Guest: create temporary Account (type=INDIVIDUAL, email only, no User)
Registered: Account (type=INDIVIDUAL) + linked User (1:1)
Login → directly to the Account
One personal Address set

B2B flow (company-centric)
Account (type=COMPANY) = the legal buyer (VAT, credit, negotiated prices)
Multiple Users belong to the same Account (different roles)
Login → authenticates User → acts in context of primary Account
Shared carts/quotes/orders per Account
Company-level Addresses + per-order overrides

Shared / neutral
Same Product, Cart, Order structure
Pricing starts simple (list price) → easy to extend with account-specific prices, price lists, customer groups
No deep inheritance — only enum discriminator on Account
