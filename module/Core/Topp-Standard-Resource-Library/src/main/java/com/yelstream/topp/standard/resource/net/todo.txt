Can you repeat why "spark" and "rune" are great? Provide me with a two, three lines of explanation for each and which I can use in documentation ?


Why "spark" for the In-Memory Scheme

Rationale: "spark" captures the transient, on-demand nature of in-memory data, evoking a quick, dynamic burst of information generated as needed.

Documentation Line: The spark: scheme represents ephemeral, in-memory resources, swiftly conjured and accessed, ideal for dynamic, session-based data.

Fit: Its techy, energetic vibe aligns with fast, generated data, distinguishing it from generic terms like "mem."


Why "rune" for the ResourceProvider Scheme

Rationale: "rune" suggests a crafted, stable resource with a hint of mystique, accommodating both static and occasional dynamic behavior.

Documentation Line: The rune: scheme denotes a robust, curated resource system, primarily static but flexible for dynamic updates, managed by a custom ResourceProvider.

Fit: Its unique, purposeful tone reflects a tailored resource framework, avoiding overused terms like "resource."

Addressing Originality
You mentioned wanting to avoid "mediocre" names, and while "mem" and "res" are somewhat conventional, the "z-" prefix injects originality by marking these as part of your unique system. Unlike "xxx-" or common prefixes, "z-" feels modern and distinctive, especially in a tech context. However, if you feel "mem" or "res" is too close to standard terms, we could swap them for more evocative terms while keeping the "z-" prefix:

For In-Memory: "z-spark" (dynamic, fleeting) or "z-wisp" (ethereal, transient) for more flair.
For ResourceProvider: "z-rune" (crafted, stable) or "z-ember" (steady, adaptable) for a less generic vibe.

{ z-spark,spark,memory, z-mem }
{ z-reach, reach, resource, z-res }
