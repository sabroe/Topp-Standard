/**
 * Location of a resource by name.
 * <p>
 *     The concepts applied:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Location -- resource name</li>
 *     <li>Container -- container of resources, a directory.</li>
 *     <li>Content -- resource content, a file.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 *     Locations of type "container" and locations of type "content" are intended to be mutually exclusive.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When classloader related,
 *     then {@link #getName()} and {@code #toString()} can be applied directly to {@link ClassLoader}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Note that implementations are expected to implement {@link Object#toString()} by returning
 *     the resource name as provided by {@link #getName()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This is immutable.
