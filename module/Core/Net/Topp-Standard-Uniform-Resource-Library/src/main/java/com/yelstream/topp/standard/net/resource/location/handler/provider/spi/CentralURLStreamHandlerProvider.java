/**
 * Provider of URL stream handlers performing protocol lookup in the central set of URL stream handler factories.
 * <p>
 *     This uses {@link URLStreamHandlerFactories#createURLStreamHandler(String)},
 *     which is mostly fixed, but may be dynamic over time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 *     Note that this is to be registered as a service under
 *     {@code META-INF/services/java.net.spi.URLStreamHandlerProvider},
 *     listed in the JPMS module definition in which this is contained,
 *     and hence will be used actively by instances of {@link java.net.URL}.
